INTRODUCTION
NOVA System - All-in-One Extravaganza
The Audible Choice
NOVA System is the complete, floor-based effects solution for the dedicated guitar player who knows quality when he
sees it. Its unique inclusion of an all-analog distortion/overdrive section under preset and expression control makes it the
perfect choice whether you want to trim down your rack setup, step up from your pedal patchwork or simply just want the
ultimate combination of operational simplicity and audio superiority.
Add to this an array of effects taken straight from the king of floor-based processors; G-System and you have top-notch
compression, EQ, noise gate, modulation, pitch, delay and reverb right at your feet. All you need is a guitar and an amp
and you’re good to go – first class.
Genuine, Analog Drive Circuit
What makes NOVA System so remarkably different is the NDT™ - NOVA Drive Technology - a unique, new drive and
distortion circuit that gets you the best of both worlds: World-class analog distortion and overdrive with digital control. This
is the real deal – no modeling. While the NDT™ is 100% analog and physically separated from the digital effects, its
control potmeters are digital. This way you can tweak, store and recall as many drive settings as you want - you can even
hook up an expression pedal and control the amount of distortion in real-time. Its wide gain range covers your every need
from light breakup to heavy distortion.

MENU - ROUTING
Routing
NOVA System has three ways of routing the chain of effects: Serial, Semi Parallel and Parallel.
Basics
• Press MENU
• Select Routing using encoder D
• Press MENU to confirm
• Set values using encoders A, B and C
• Change pages using encoder D
• Confirm by pressing MENU
• Exit by pressing MENU again
Serial
The Serial routing connects all effect blocks “in a straight line”. This means that each effect block affects the following
effect(s).
If a delay with a long delay time is used in combination with a reverb, you may find the added reverb on the delay
repeats disturbing. In that case, use either the Semi Parallel or Parallel routing.
12

MENU - ROUTING
Semi Parallel
The Semi Parallel routing connects most effect blocks serially, but the reverb and delay blocks are now connected in
parallel. Consequently, the delay and reverb effects do not affect each other. This means that no reverb is added to the
delay repeats.
Parallel
In the Parallel routing, the same signal is fed to the input of the modulation, delay and reverb sections, and therefore
these effects will not affect each other.

transition between the “gated/attenuated” stage and the

high.

The Tap Master parameter – located in the Utility

When you set this parameter to 100%, the signal will
sweep fully from the left to right. You will find, however,
that for most applications, a more subtle setting is more
appropriate, as it blends more elegantly with the overall

Use the Hi Lev and Lo Lev parameters to emphasize or
attenuate the selected Hi and Lo Color types.
Early
Range: -100 to 0 dB
This parameter sets the level of the reverb’s initial
reflections (early reflections).
RevLev – Reverb Level
Range: -100 to 0 dB
This parameter sets the level of the reverb’s diffuse field.
Diff – Diffuse
Range: -25 to 25
With this parameter, you can fine-tune the density of the
reverb’s diffuse field. It is set automatically when you
select a decay time and allows you to reduce flutter in
the diffuse field to an absolute minimum.
