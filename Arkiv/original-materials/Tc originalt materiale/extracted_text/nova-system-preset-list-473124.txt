User banks 00-19 have 3 memory locations each which can be used to store your own presets.
Furthermore you can store up to 4 instant effects variation settings for each FX block, so you can easily
exchange single effects and try out different combinations on the fly.
This becomes very handy when creating your own presets. Once you have found a particular effects setting
you like, store it as a variation (press and hold one of the Variation buttons).
Next time you wish for this setting to be added to any other preset, just press the selected FX button and the
variation button will load and replace the current FX setting of your selected FX block.
For more information please refer to the Nova System User Manual.
